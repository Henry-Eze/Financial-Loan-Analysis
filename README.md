The analysis is conducted using a dataset comprising various loan applications, encompassing parameters such as: Customer ID, Annual Income, Loan term, Loan purpose, Debt to Income (DTI) ratio, Interest Rate, Instalmental payment etc.
This analysis dose not only end on the diversity of the data sources “Financial loan2 xlsx” but also in our ability in transforming this multidimensional information into actionable reports. It’s evident that in our word, we leverage on the power of data to innovate, plan, transform, and derive meaningful results in shaping the future of our companies.

  ## Cutting-edge analytical tools:
  - Excel – dataset extraction format
  - Power Query Editor – cleaning of data
  - Excel Pivot table – data visualization 
	    -[Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  - Excel worksheet – to perform mathematical calculation.
    
The choice of tool often depends on factors like the nature of the dataset, the complexity of analysis needed, ease of use, and the specific requirements of the project or organization. 

## Data Cleaning
Cleaning financial loan data is critical for accurate analysis. Here's a general process for cleaning financial data:
-	Remove duplicates and non-needed columns and rows.
-	Date cleaning, transformation, and column addition.
-	Empty cell
-	Check for data integrity.
-	Merge and split data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often times employing visual methods. Its major objective is to understand the data, discover trends and patterns by answering some of the questions below:
### Key Performance Indicators (KPI) requirements
- What are the total loan applications?
- What is the total month to date (MTD) and month over month (MoM) loan?
- What is the total funded loan amount?
- What is the total amount received from borrowers?
- What is the average interest rate and debt to income (DTI) ratio?

### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s:
- What is the percentage of good and bad loan applications?
- What is the total count of good and bad loan applications?
- What is the good and bad loan funded amount?
- What is the good and bad loan total received amount?
- What month has the highest loan application?

- What is the distribution of loan through employment length of service among the borrowers?
- What is the breakdown of the loan purpose?
- What is the influence of home ownership on securing loans? 

## Data Analysis:
In Excel, several metrics and calculations can be performed to extract insight from the dataset and is contained in the “Design Sheet”. 

## Findings

- Employee’s who have worked for 10+ years had the highest number of applications followed by those with less than 1 year, 2 years work length in such an ascending other. This does not reflect the true 
  pattern and need to investigated.
-	Just from the insight drawn from the data, it showed that borrowers borrow more in December.
-	Loan Status – All things being equal, the result showed a very high proportion of borrowers who have fully paid up their loan, charged off, current running loan of 32k, 5.3k and 1.1k respectively by   
  count. More so, Interest rate for fully paid-up borrowers is 11.6%, Charged off borrowers (Written off) is 13.8% and current borrowers interest rate is 15.1%.
-	Loan term analysis has shown that loan tenors greater that 36 months to 60 months pulled a total of 73% as against 27% for tenors less than 36 months.

Understanding this interplay is vital for informed decision-making within the financial services sector. Additionally, risk assessment models play a pivotal role in mitigating loan defaults, highlighting the importance of continuously refining these models. In the end, leveraging data-driven insights is instrumental in optimizing lending processes, managing risks, and fostering a more robust financial ecosystem.


## Recommendations
After analyzing the loan dataset, here are some recommendations that could enhance the viability and optimization of bank loans:
-	Implement a refined risk assessment models considering demographic, credit, and income factors for more accurate loan evaluations.
-	Offer targeted financial education programs to applicants with lower credit scores or higher risk profiles.
-	Continuously monitor and update loan approval criteria to adapt to changing economic conditions and borrower profiles.
-	The terms of the consolidation loan should be favorable, offering a reasonable repayment period and flexibility in payment schedules. This prevents any undue financial strain on the borrower.
-	Fixed Interest Rates: Opting for a consolidation plan with a fixed interest rate helps in budgeting and prevents unexpected spikes in payments due to floating interest rates.
-	Improved Credit Score: If managed properly, debt consolidation can positively impact credit scores. Timely payments and a reduced credit utilization ratio may improve creditworthiness over time.
-	Payment Plans: Offer flexible repayment plans that suit the borrower's financial situation. This can involve smaller, regular payments over an extended period, making it easier for the borrower to 
  fulfill the obligation.
-	Legal Action: If all attempts at negotiation fail, legal action might be necessary. This could involve filing a lawsuit to obtain a court judgment against the borrower. However, legal proceedings can be    costly and time-consuming.
-	Collateral Liquidation: If the debt is secured by collateral, such as assets or property, repossession or liquidation of the collateral might be an option to recover the owed amount.
